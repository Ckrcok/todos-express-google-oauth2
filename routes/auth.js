// Configure the Facebook strategy for use by Passport.
//
// OAuth 2.0-based strategies require a `verify` function which receives the
// credential (`accessToken`) for accessing the Facebook API on the user's
// behalf, along with the user's profile.  The function must invoke `cb`
// with a user object, which will be set at `req.user` in route handlers after
// authentication.

// TODO 3 Configure the Google strategy for use by Passport.

  
// Configure Passport authenticated session persistence.
//
// In order to restore authentication state across HTTP requests, Passport needs
// to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  In a
// production-quality application, this would typically be as simple as
// supplying the user ID when serializing, and querying the user record by ID
// from the database when deserializing.  However, due to the fact that this
// example does not have a database, the complete Facebook profile is serialized
// and deserialized.

// TODO 4 Configure Passport authenticated session persistence.

 *
 * Once Google has completed their interaction with the user, the user will be
 * redirected back to the app at `GET /oauth2/redirect/accounts.google.com`.
